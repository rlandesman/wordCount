NEW ORLEANS—Standing in line at the hardware store on the edge of the French Quarter one December Monday, I overheard the cashier talking to a regular customer about manhole covers that had exploded just before dawn that morning a couple of blocks away. The metal discs had burst into buildings and crashed into the underside of a car, which in turn caught fire. Power outages and evacuations had ensued. This was just the latest addition to a cluster of troubling events. In the previous few days, a turbine powering the low-lying city’s storm-drainage system had also exploded, unrelated water-main ruptures had flooded neighborhoods on opposite sides of town, and a cyberattack had crippled City Hall. Not to mention the usual spate of shootings that punctuate the daily news in New Orleans.

The other customer, a longtime Quarter resident, asked the cashier and me whether we thought that morning’s explosion was terrorism. “This city doesn’t even need terrorists,” the cashier replied. “The city terrorizes itself.”

Outside the store’s plate-glass windows, traffic inched along North Rampart Street. Five blocks up, the street was closed. It had been impaled in late October by part of a construction crane, which was being used to build a Hard Rock Hotel on the corner of North Rampart and Canal Street—the city’s main thoroughfare. The crane had remained precariously upright when the unfinished hotel partially collapsed earlier in October, and local authorities intentionally imploded it in an effort to stabilize the 18-story ruin.

That part of the crane got stuck deep in the pavement was hardly the worst of it. The original accident on October 12 had killed three workers and injured dozens. One worker claimed that construction had been rushed so the hotel could open by Mardi Gras. Instead, at the time of year when the rest of the United States pays the most attention to New Orleans, two bodies remained trapped in the rubble, turning the ruins in the city’s heart into a massive, slouching tomb.

Mardi Gras is next Tuesday. It’s the culmination of the annual Carnival celebration, which is the cornerstone of this city’s cultural identity. As a native New Orleanian, I’ve enjoyed the costuming and the parades and the marching bands for more than four decades. But our city’s vaunted joie de vivre and reputation for throwing the country’s biggest party are also complicated by issues shared by many American cities: neglected infrastructure, a deepening housing crisis, widening inequality, profound racial injustice, and a deadly threat from climate change. The situation is just worse here than in most places, New Orleans being notoriously resistant to change.

This recent spate of civic calamities has made the underlying problems harder for citizens to ignore. This Carnival in particular, I find myself wondering whether things here could be different—and by different I mean better. Can we be fabulous while also being responsible toward our environment? Can we acknowledge that we host our epic celebration in a fragile city on the front lines of global warming, at the edge of deteriorating wetlands, and beset by sea-level rise and increasingly fierce storms—and party accordingly?

On the short drive home from the hardware store, I contemplated the cashier’s idea of a self-terrorizing city. I’d already recognized that my fellow New Orleanians and I lived in a self-terrorizing state. Louisiana sits at or near the bottom of national rankings related to education, health care, crime, and infrastructure. New Orleans monetizes what it can. The marketing of our culture has led to a crush of tourism and a heavy reliance on low-paying service-industry jobs, reinforcing our legacy of racism and poverty and stressing our already precarious built environment. In 2018, 46 tons of toxic Mardi Gras beads were extracted from the drainage system that’s supposed to keep our streets from filling up like the canals of Venice. Meanwhile, half of our city’s children attend schools whose quality is rated by the state as either D or F.

Turns out a bomb did explode those manhole covers—a shit bomb. Methane generated from human waste in the sewerage vault leaked into the underground power lines and sparked an explosion, an occurrence symptomatic of a very distressed system. One unexploded manhole cover lifted by a city worker revealed a mess inches beneath the streets of the Quarter: a perfect circle jammed with plastic to-go cups, Mardi Gras beads, novelty shot glasses shaped like miniature hand grenades, and soggy stolen wallets and purses tossed into gutters. This finding wasn’t merely a metaphor for overtourism and our laissez-faire attitudes toward the obvious problems confronting our city—it was a literal, concrete manifestation.
